												<h3>Smart & Amazing People</h3>
												<p>I was blown away by how interesting sounding projects, and talent of leadership. Not that the folks I worked with previously were not talented. However, I wanted to engage with clients in a different way, and I felt that leadership at Slalom was taking a fresh approach.</p>

												<h3>Opportunity to Build</h3>
												<p>I want to be part of a practice that I can help build. As Chris puts it, Strategy and Operations at Slalom is still a "start-up" of a practice. I want to contribute to how the team operates, as well as impact how other practices within Slalom will perceive our group.</p>
