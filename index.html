												<h3>Smart & Amazing People</h3>
												<p>Throughout the interview process at Slalom, I was blown away by how interesting the projects sounded, and how talented leadership was. Not that the folks I worked with at Deloitte were not talented, however, I wanted to engage with clients in a different way, and I felt that leadership at Slalom was taking a different approach.</p>

												<h3>Opportunity to Build</h3>
												<p>I want to be part of a practice that I can help build. As Chris puts it, Strategy and Operations at Slalom is still a "start-up" of a practice, and I want to contribute to how the team operates, as well as impact how other practices in Slalom will perceive our group.</p>

												<h3>Opportunity to Help Clients Succeed</h3>
												<p>What attracted me the most, was the opportunity to work on projects that will help clients increase revenue, innovate, and grow. With my previous work, I helped implement processes that ultimately mitigated risk, which was engaging, but was not a passion of mine. Slalom offered me a change in pace with the type of consulting I would be giving, which is what I want to be doing with my career.</p>

										<h3>What about your Professional Experience?</h3>
										<div class="content">
										<p> Prior to joining Slalom, I was a Cyber Strategy consultant at Deloitte. I helped multi-billion dollar clients redesign IT Asset management (ITAM) processes & controls, and helped with IT organizational structuring to support the ITAM function. I also helped with implementing tools to automate Software Asset Management Processes.</P>
